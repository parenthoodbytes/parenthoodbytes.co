					<h3>Episode Notes</h3>	
					<div class="content">
						In this episode, we have a conversation with Kate Lee, an Engineering Manager at LTK, currently based in the Bay Area. Kate, with 6-7 years of experience in the tech industry, transitioned from being an iOS Engineer to an Engineering Manager after parental leave and welcoming her 2.5-year-old son.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Kate opens up about the common parental struggle of wondering if she's doing enough. She shares her personal approach to overcoming this. Kate highlights how the flexibility of remote work has allowed her to spend more quality time with her child, attending to his needs and fostering a stronger connection.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						One of the significant realizations Kate shares is the shift in priorities that parenthood brings. She candidly acknowledges that, while at work, one might be replaceable, the role of a parent at home is irreplaceable. This recognition has influenced her perspective on work-life balance and the importance of being present for her child.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Kate offers a valuable tip for new parents, advising them to pursue significant career jumps or side projects before having kids. She encourages them not to be afraid to set themselves up for success. Despite the inevitable stresses of parenting, particularly with younger children, Kate emphasizes the importance of savoring the moment, as time doesn't come back.
