					<h3>Episode Notes</h3>	
					<div class="content">
						In this installment, we sit down with Mahima, an Engineering Manager who currently lives in New York. She brings 18 years of tech industry experience to the table. Despite a career-focused trajectory in the earlier part of her professional life, Mahima became a parent just a few years ago, and her one-and-a-half-year-old son has since reshaped her priorities.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Mahima candidly shares how the first decade-plus of her career was predominantly centered around her professional pursuits, but the recent years have seen a deliberate effort to strike a balance between career and personal life.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Offering valuable advice to fellow parents, Mahima stresses the importance of not attempting to juggle everything at once. Recognizing that the initial 1-2 years of parenthood can be challenging, she encourages parents to go easy on themselves and fully embrace parental leave. Mahima advocates for a gradual return to work and advises collaborating with both the team and manager to establish a well-thought-out plan. She reassures parents that returning at full throttle is not the expectation, and self-compassion is key during this transitional period. Tune in for Mahima's insights on navigating the complexities of parenthood and career in the tech world.
