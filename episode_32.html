					<h3>Episode Notes</h3>	
					<div class="content">
						In this episode, we chat with Berkley Hinton, a Product Manager based in the Bay Area. Despite managing a dynamic household that includes his 9-year-old daughter, step-daughters aged 13 and 22, and being a step-grandfather to a 6-month-old boy, Berkley adeptly balances his responsibilities.</div>
					<div class="content">He discusses the intricacies of juggling parenting duties, caring for his 86-year-old mother, raising three kids + a grandson, writing a book, and excelling in his role as a Product Manager. Berkley emphasizes the importance of setting boundaries in the workplace, advocating for work-life balance, and prioritizing quality time with his partner amidst his busy schedule.</div>
					<div class="content">
						Encouraging parents to embrace the journey of parenthood, Berkley suggests taking the leap into parenthood if it's on your mind. He also offers advice to men, urging them to be more supportive partners and recognize the magnitude of the challenges faced by their significant others, emphasizing that it's often much tougher than they may perceive.</div>
					<div class="content">
						You can purchase Berkley's book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Burning-World-1-Berkley-Hinton/dp/1098339509/" target="_blank">Burning World</a>, on Amazon. (If the page shows as it is out of stock, they will publish on demand, so you can still purchase it.)
