					<h3>Episode Notes</h3>	
					<div class="content">
						In this episode, we reconnect with Mallika Rao, an engineering manager at Netflix, who previously joined us on <a href="episode_30.html"> 30</a>. At that time, she was pregnant with her second child and had a toddler at home. Her kids are now 5 months and 3 years old. Mallika shares her transformative experiences since the birth of her second child, discussing shifts in her mindset and daily life. She reflects on her evolving parenting approach, including how she introduced the concept of pregnancy to her older son and facilitated their introduction to the newborn. She shares insights into how she prepared her family and herself for the newborn, what steps she took, and how she made sure to have a support system in place, despite most of her family not living nearby. She also talks to us about the difference between a doula and a nanny and why a doula is helpful for mom and newborn during the postpartum phase. Tune in to hear about her journey through motherhood and the joys and challenges of raising a growing family!
