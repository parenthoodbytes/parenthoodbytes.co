					<h3>Episode Notes</h3>	
					<div class="content">
						In this episode, we have a fascinating conversation with Mallika Rao, an engineering manager at Netflix residing in the Bay Area. Mallika, who is currently expecting her second child (with a 22-month-old son already), provides insights into her transition from an individual contributor (IC) to an engineering manager (EM). She discusses how her professional journey has been influenced by the arrival of her first child and how she has adjusted her priorities and focus accordingly.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						Mallika emphasizes the importance of flexibility and adaptability, noting that parenthood has prompted her to reevaluate and reorganize her approach to work and life. She candidly shares the challenges she faces in balancing her career aspirations with her growing family responsibilities, acknowledging that this balance is a continuous work in progress.
					</div>
					<div class="content">
						One of Mallika's key messages is the importance of self-care and making time for oneself amidst the demands of both work and family life. She encourages listeners to recognize that it's okay for priorities to shift and evolve, especially with the arrival of children, and to be gentle with themselves during this process.
